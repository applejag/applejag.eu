This is my blog :)

For starters, I've mostly just transferred some of my posts from other social platforms. Mostly from my tumblr page. I write about 1 blog post per year.

## About me

My name is Kalle. A young'ish back-end developer from the eastern archipelago of Sweden.

## What's this blog about

Mostly personal stuff I come across. Either knowledge I want to share (in form of guides) or experiences I want to share (usually in form of rants).

Expect content related to the following areas:

- Hobby programming projects (see [#devlog](/blog/tags/devlog))
- Work related rants (see [#rant](/blog/tags/rant))
- Or anything else relating: C#, F#, .NET, Go, PHP, Lua, ComputerCraft... *I.e. random programming "stuff"...* (see [#programming](/blog/tags/programming))

This blog was previously hosted at <https://blog.jillejr.tech>, but I was running a self-hosted version of [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/). The Fediverse integration was cool, but not that great. It also was a hassle to self-host.

Now the blog is instead written in [Astro](https://astro.build), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jilleJr/applejag.eu).
