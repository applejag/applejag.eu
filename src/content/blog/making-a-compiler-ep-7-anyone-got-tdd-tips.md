I’m quite burnt out atm, have had 12 consecutive 8 hour work days, so my mind is kinda fried. Help a soul out would I?

In my adventure of doing this in the spiritanimalkingdom of test-driven development, anymes got a neat solution in their cranium capsule of how I could make this code more readable?

![Bloated unit tests](/blog/making-a-compiler-ep-7-anyone-got-tdd-tips/tumblritsa-me-jag17276818601701.png)<!--more-->

I always dislike how assertion code looks, but this is just unbearable to read!

Could someone like take a code design class and then go yell at me what I could do instead?,, because I’ve noooooo yolking clue how to handle these nested statements in a readable fashion.

Thank anymes in advance! I think I appreciate it!
