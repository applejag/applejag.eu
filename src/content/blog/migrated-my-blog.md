Moving from basic Tumblr, to Fediverse-powered Write-Freely, and now to Astro on GitHub pages.

Moving all of my posts has been a very tedious and manual process. And while doing so, I've noticed that I mostly blog around new-year. Most posts are around Nov - Mar. Curious!

But I like the setup. And it's hosted by GitHub pages, but its just some statically generated HTML files so it can live wherever.
