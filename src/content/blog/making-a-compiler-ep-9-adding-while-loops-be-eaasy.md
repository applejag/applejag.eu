This was a feature I didn‚Äôt add because I just imagined it would be done in an hour or so.

Oh how I was wrong. It took me FULL 90 MINUTES!

What took the most time was writing all those stupid unit tests. Implementing `if-else`, `while`, and `do-while` was arguably the easiest thing I‚Äôve added. With my UNQUESTIONABLY SENSATIONALISTIC CODE BASE it was added in a jiffy.  üçÜ‚úäüí¶

That right there ^ was like, echo conditional jump, echo codeblock, echo label, DDdddDDONE!<!--more-->

Also, check out this sicc‚Ñ¢ mini optimization:

Which in turns combined with a prefix operator makes this little loop super cool:

I should reaaaally make a roadmap for planned features tho‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to procrastinate,,, which is bhaaaad. Like I really need to implement that variable type check, but it‚Äôs such a big hurdle D:::

Go nail yo‚Äôshelf,,,¬¥,,,,,

Cheerio!
